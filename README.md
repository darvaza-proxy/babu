## Overview

The **Babu** Project, from the [Akkadian][akkad-wikipedia] *bƒÅbu*
meaning *gate*, is a scalable SSH tunnel management system designed
to handle thousands of client connections with integrated services
and centralised management.

Babu provides three core components:

1. **`babu-server`** - SSH server replacing OpenSSH with dual functionality:
   - Virtual ports for device clients (no TCP binding)
   - Full shell access for administrators
2. **`babu`** - Specialised SSH client with integrated service support
3. **`babu-proxy`** - Tool for admin access to devices via virtual ports

## Key Features

- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle 10,000+ concurrent clients
- **Port-Based Identity**: Unique port assignments for client identification
- **Integrated Services**: NTP, DNS, and SOCKS5 proxies over SSH
- **Git-Backed Configuration**: Version-controlled client management
- **Automatic Re-keying**: Detects and handles compromised keys

## Components

### `babu-server`

A complete SSH server implementation with innovative virtual port technology:

- **For devices**: Handles `-R` port forwarding without TCP binding
  - Virtual ports enable unlimited device connections
  - Device user `babu` has restricted access via `authorized_keys`
  - Compatible with standard SSH clients
- **For administrators**: Provides full shell access
  - Root and admin users get normal SSH shells
  - System management capabilities
- Provides integrated services (NTP, DNS, SOCKS5) via SSH channels
- Manages client registration and re-keying
- Detects key compromise through concurrent usage

### `babu-proxy`

A reverse proxy tool that:

- Enables administrators to connect to client SSH services
- Lists available clients and their connection status
- Creates port forwarding for client-side services
- Integrates with SSH `ProxyCommand` for transparent access

### `babu`

The intelligent SSH client that:

- Manages persistent connections to Babu servers
- Handles automatic pre-registration with factory keys
- Acts as local proxy for DNS, NTP, and SOCKS5 services
- Maintains connection reliability with automatic reconnection

## Pre-registration Process

New clients can self-register using factory keys:

1. Client connects with a shared factory key
2. Client generates a unique SSH key pair
3. Server assigns a unique name and port ID
4. Client uses assigned identity for future connections
5. Factory hostname can be updated to assigned name

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install Babu
go install darvaza.org/babu/cmd/babu@latest
go install darvaza.org/babu/cmd/babu-server@latest
go install darvaza.org/babu/cmd/babu-proxy@latest

# Start the server
babu-server --config /etc/babu/server.yaml

# Connect a client
babu connect --server babu.example.com --port 30001
```
